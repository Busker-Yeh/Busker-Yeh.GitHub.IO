In the past, it would be a happy thing if we could play the Super Mario under the ms-dos in the computer classrooms; we could have fun when the tape player had low battery; the cans and bottles could become the best toys if we had nothing else to enjoy.

At present, 16-bit operating system has become a history; the MP3 player will give us accurate sound no matter whether it is in high or low battery; The cans and bottles are thrown as junk into the trash bin.

I tried to make a piece of music in remembrance of my childhood and the fun of that time. I got a box of "Spam" (Interestingly it means junk mail now) from a trash bin, and recorded several sounds merely of it, and played back the sounds like a tape player in low battery.
