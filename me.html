Hello, Iâ€™m Yeh, a busker at Canberra. Although I have merely a cheapest hand recorder (Zoom H1) and a laptop with low frequency CPU (1.60GHz), I think I can try something new by using these scant equipments as a minimalism enthusiast. Thus I set up this little website to share my pieces and my ideas, as well as my life.
